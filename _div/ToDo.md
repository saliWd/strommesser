# StromMesser TODOs

1. StromMesser wordpress
   1. fill with content: rather abstract stuff
   1. SEO stuff
2. StromMesser/verbrauch
   1. password / device as variable

   1. meas   
      1. current consumption
         1. monitor: about 26 mA (10 Ah = 3 days)? 5Ah did also work for 3 days?
         2. check solar panel setup: min consumption of 40 mA is an issue. 
            * with adding 110 Ohm on two pins (actually 2 x 30 mA) and setting the CPU to 240 MHz, it's working. Without either of those, it's shutting off (200 MHz works for some time but not reliably). Had one shutdown also with the 240 MHz. But apart from that, was working nicely. Will need several resistor options
      2. stability
         1. monitor, again...
