# StromMesser TODOs

1. Wordpress
   1. copy the content from WP to static page
      * not an ideal solution, quite a big effort and in the end still missing links/non-working buttons
   1. cta button on main page: Kontakt + Demo-Account
   1. parts / panels
      1. main page: change strommesser image (currently white background)
      1. panel 1: ~~Auswertungen~~
      1. panel 2: ~~Was braucht es dazu?~~
      1. panel 3: Demo-Account (cta-2)
      1. panel 4: Kontakt (cta) -> solve blueish border?
      1. panel 5: Login (add form on it)
   1. ~~Two additional pages:~~
      1. ~~Abo~~
      1. ~~GerÃ¤te -> long page, more info.~~
   1. fill with more content: explanation?
2. Folder verbrauch
   1. ~~general~~
   2. ~~getRaw.php~~
   3. index.php
      1. make it configurable, which graphs to show (in settings)
      1. on non-mobile, limit the height/size of the first graph, have them one next to the other?
   4. ~~login.php~~
   5. ~~rx.php~~
   6. settings.php:
      1. which graphs to show on index -> makes it more complicated and difficult to test. Maybe not worth the work?
         * rather have links to the corresponding graph on the statistic site
      1. change email
   7. statistic.php
      1. explanation for cost graph different
      1. add table layout with numbers additional to graphs
3. pico devices
   1. print my own case for measurement
      * [ir head case][irHeadCase]
      * [pico case][picoCase]
   1. disp
      1. [case?][displayCase]
4. div
