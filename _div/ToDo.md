# StromMesser TODOs

1. StromMesser wordpress
   1. do it myself but use Pique as an inspiration. Better looking than lodestar (but too much stuff around)
      * How-to? Have a (non-crawlable) WP-temp folder. Method II: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/giving-wordpress-its-own-directory/
   1. fill with more content: explanation?
   1. login form on WP / 'bigger' link
   1. different WP design. Single page. Decision taken for "lodestar" (alternative: Pique)
      * cta button on main page
      * need pages (short ones) as panel
         1. ~~Was ist es?~~ -> own panel
         1. Was brauchst du?
         1. Demo-Account (cta-2)
         1. Interesse (cta)
         1. Login (add form on it)
         1. Kontakt (not yet)
      * unclear how to integrate those two:
         * Abo
         * GerÃ¤te -> long page, more info.

3. pico devices
   1. stability since 10.01.23: mixed. Lots of good streaks (several days ok). issue 08.03.2023: several power cycles needed. 9.3.23 again
      * checking on WLAN side: if status is not 200, do a reboot? With a timeout? 
      * check with WLAN disconnection
      * could also be an issue on usb power supply?
      * does not (always) recover from issue on server side. Need more stable reset mechanism
   1. print my own case for measurement
      * [ir head case][irHeadCase]
      * [pico case][picoCase]
   1. disp
