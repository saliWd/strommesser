# installation instruction

   * download node-v18.18.2-x64.msi (tested with this version)
   * install node into _div\nodejs\latest - directory
      * the whole 'latest' directory is afterwards write protected (on one installation). Security measures?
   * start a admin console and do: npm install tailwindcss flowbite chart.js
      * should result in something like "added 86 packages, and removed 250 packages"
   * do a repair of nodejs installation (ugly work around, _npm install_ somewhat removes a lot)
   * runTailwindcss.bat (might result in a permission denied message for the copy command, do it manually if required)
      * should result in _rebuilding_
