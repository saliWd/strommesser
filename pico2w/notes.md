+ Micropython installation


need an uf2 file with pimoroni picographics included. For RPI2350 (pico 2W).
I need the rp2 version from here https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico-rp2350/releases (version number 0.1.0, 1.25 preview)

(this one does not work (for 2040 chip): https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases: picow-v1.25.0-pimoroni-micropython.uf2)
